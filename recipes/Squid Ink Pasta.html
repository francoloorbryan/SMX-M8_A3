  <p>Okay, I know. This is one of those weird ones.
  <br>
  But if you are looking for something spooky and delicious for Halloween, squid ink pasta is perfect. Pair it with a
  bright orange pumpkin, and you are set!

  <h1>What Is Squid Ink Pasta</h1>
  <p>
  Have you ever had squid ink pasta?
  <br>
  It's pasta that has been flavored (and naturally colored) with jet black squid ink. Which now that I think about it,
  doesn't sound particularly appetizing, unless of course you've tried it. In which case you will go to great lengths to
  obtain and consume it.</p>

  <p>
  Squid ink pasta is absolutely delicious! Like, don't-bother-me, leave-me-alone-while-I-savor-this, wow-this-is-good,
  delicious.
  <br>
  As for the specific taste? The pasta itself is only lightly flavored with the squid ink, so the pasta tastes like pasta,
  just really good. (How's that for an explanation?)
  <br>
  I developed this recipe to be sort of like a deconstructed classic pumpkin ravioli in sage brown butter sauce, except
  that the pumpkin is on the outside, and the pasta with the sage brown butter sauce is on the inside.
  <br>
  To eat it, you can take a small scoop of pumpkin from the inside of the pumpkin and swirl it with a little pasta.

  haven't yet cooked, so I'm looking for ideas, thanks!

  <div class="ingredients">
    <h1>&#126 Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>4 small sugar pumpkins, each about 1 pound to 1 1/2 pound</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>2 to 4 teaspoons of white sugar, or 2 to 4 Tbsp of brown sugar (to taste)</li>
      <li>1 pound squid ink pasta</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh sage leaves (with a few small whole leaves for garnish)</li>
      <li>A splash of apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Heat the oven to 190ºC. Slice off the top quarter of each pumpkin and scoop out the insides. (Save the seeds to make
      toasted pumpkin seeds.)
      <br>
      Using a strong metal spoon or a small sharp knife, scrape all the fibrous insides out of the pumpkins. Sprinkle the
      insides of the pumpkins with salt and sugar.</li>
      <li>Set the pumpkins on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F for 1 hour, or until a fork easily pierces the flesh and the edges
      are lightly browned.</li>
      <img class="pumpkin" src="/images/pumpkin.webp" alt="" width="300px">
      <li>Prepare the pasta water while the pumpkins are cooking. Bring a large pot of well salted water (it should taste like the
      sea) to a boil. When the pumpkins have about 10 minutes to go before they're done, add the pasta to the boiling water.
      <br>
      When the pumpkins are cooked remove them from the oven to a serving dish or plates.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the brown butter sauce. Heat the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the
      sage leaves and cook until browned bits begin to form in the butter and there is a lovely nutty aroma.
      <br>
      Remove the pan from the heat and pour the brown butter into a large serving bowl (this will stop the butter from cooking
      further). Browned butter can easily turn to blackened butter, which is not the flavor you want for this recipe
      </li>
      <li>When the pasta is ready (al dente, slightly firm, but cooked through), use tongs to remove the pasta from the pot to the
      large bowl with the brown butter.
      <br>
      Allow some of the water from the pasta to drip into the bowl, it will help with the sauce. Toss the pasta with the brown
      butter.
      <br>
      Splash a little cider vinegar over it. Taste for salt, it will likely need a bit more, especially if you've used
      unsalted butter. Add more if needed.</li>
      <li>Serve the pasta in the baked pumpkin shells. Garnish with reserved whole sage leaves that you had cooked with the sliced
      sage in the butter.</li>
