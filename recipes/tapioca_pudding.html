    <p>One of my faorite desserts growing up was tapioca pudding. You don't see it that much anymore. Kids get pre-made puddings fromm the grocery store
        <p>
        Yet tapioca pudding is one of those comfort fodds that conjures up happy childhood memorie. It's actually really easy to make.

        Tapioca pudding
    </h2>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Look at the instructions on the package of tapioca that you buy. Some smal pearl tapioca requires overnight soaking in water. If your package has that requirement, reduce the milk in the recipe to 2 1/2 cups from 3 cups</p>

            Method
        </h2>
        <div class="method">
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the tapioca</li>
                    <p>Combine tapioca, milk, and salt in 1 1/2 quart pan on medium high heat. Stir while bringing to a bare simmer. Lower the
                    heat and cook uncovered, at the lowest possible heat, adding sugar gradually, until the tapioca pearls have plumped up
                    and thickened.
                    
                    Depending on the type or brand of tapioca you are using and if you've presoaked the tapioca as some brands call for,
                    this could take anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes of cooking at a very low temperature.
                    
                    Stir occasionally so that the tapioca doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>
                <li>Temper the eggs wit a little hot tapioca</li>
                    <p>Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Whisk in some of the hot tapioca very slowly to equalize the temperature of the two
                    mixtures (to avoid curdling).</p>
                <li>Return eggs to pan wiht tapioca</li>
                    <p>Increase the heat to medium and stir for several minutes until you get a thick pudding consistency. Do not let the
                    mixture boil or the tapioca egg custard will curdle. Cool 15 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Serve either warm or chilled.
                    
                    <b>Note:</b> If you want to make a more light and fluffy, but still rich, tapioca pudding, separate the eggs. Use the egg yolks
                    to stir in first to the pan with the tapioca. Once the pudding has become nice and thick, beat the egg whites in a
                    separate bowl to soft peaks. Remove the pan of tapioca pudding from the stove, fold in the beaten egg whites into the
                    pudding.</p>
