  <p>Homemade calzones are a special easy-to-make dinner (even or a weeknight). Sometimes, I even crave them over the best
  pizza.
  <br>
  This recipe uses a no knead pizza dough that can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and kept in the fridge or up to 3
  months in advance and frozen. Calzones are also great way to use up that leftover jar of pasta sauce sitting in the back
  of your fridge because you only need about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of sauce.
  <br>
  For this version, I start with an easy and simple no-knead pizza dough then stuff it with pepperoni, creamy ricotta, and
  gooey mozzarella. In the end, you have crackling golden brown crust and a handheld dinner perfect for dipping in extra
  marinara sauce!

  <h1>How to Make Calzones</h1>
  <span>Calzones are easy to make a home and a fun way to get the whole family involved. Just keep these simple steps in mind.</span>
  <div class="ingredients">
    <h1>&#126 Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds preapred pizza dough</li>
      <li>4-6 tablespoons marinara sauce, plus more for dipping</li>
      <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces pepperoni sliced</li>
      <li>8 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped frsh oregano</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <section>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F</li>
      <li>Using the prepared pizza dough, split the dough into 4 evenly sized balls for large calzones or 6 for smaller ones. Work
      with one dough ball at a time and keep the remaining dough balls covered so they don’t dry out.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough ball to a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin roll it out until you have a circle that is 6-8
      inches in diameter, again depending on size you are looking for. If you are making four larger calzones, I would shoot
      for around 8 inches in diameter. If making the smaller version go for 6-inches.
      <br>
      Roll out all the dough balls, so you can have an assembly line when it comes to time to fill the calzones. In the end
      you should have what looks like 4 to 6 mini pizza crusts waiting to be filled.</li>
      <li>Leave a 1/2-inch boarder around the edge the dough so you can seal it later. Add about a tablespoon of marinara sauce on
      one half of the dough circle. Top the sauce with about two tablespoons of ricotta and spread it out over half of the
      dough, remembering to leave the boarder. Repeat with all remaining dough circles. Divide the diced pepperoni,
      mozzarella, and fresh oregano evenly among the calzones.</li>

      <li>Once you have added the filling, dip your finger in some water and run it lightly around the edge of the calzone. Then
      take the unfilled side of the dough and fold it over the filling. Pinch the edges closed.</li>
      <li>Use a serrated knife to cut three slits in the top of each calzone to allow for steam to escape as it bakes.</li>

      <li>Once your calzones are sealed, make the egg wash. Add the egg and 1 tablespoon of water in small bowl and beat with a
      fork until combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top of the calzones.</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the calzones in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the
      calzones are a deep golden brown all around.</li>
      <li>Serve the calzones while warm with extra marinara for dipping.</li>

  <div class="steps">
    <ol>
      <li>Start with your favorite pizza dough. Personally, I use this no knead pizza dough, which makes a perfect batch of dough
      for four to six calzones depending on how large you like your calzones. You will need 2 hours to make it and let it
      rise, but you can also make it up to 48 hours in advance and keep it in the fridge until you’re ready.</li>
      <li>Fill the calzones the way you like them. I prefer a thin layer of marinara sauce and ricotta topped with sliced pepperoni and mozzarella cheese, but really any order will do.</li>
      <li>Don’t fill the calzone all the way to the edge of the dough. You need room to seal the edges together.</li>
      <li>To help the calzone seal, rub the edges of the calzone dough with a little water.</li>
      <li>Crimp it closed with your fingers. (You can also use a fork to crimp the calzones, but I think fingers work better).
      </li>
      <li>Once the calzones are sealed, brush them with egg wash and cut some slits in the each calzone to allow steam to escape
      as they bake.</li>

  <h1>Difference between Clazones and Stromboli</h1>
  <p>These are very close and sometimes get confused. Generally, a Stromboli is rolled up like a cinnamon roll and a calzone
  is folded. Both generally include cheese like ricotta or mozzarella and a mix of meat and vegetables. Stromboli tends to
  feature layers of ingredients similar to a sandwich while calzones have more of a chopped filling.
  <br>
  I’ve always found calzones to be a bit easier to make and generally that’s what I make at home.</p>
  <h1>Filling suggestions and substitutions</h1>
  <span>You can go absolutely crazy with calzone filling. Pretty much anything you could put on a pizza you can put in a
  calzone!</span>
  <br>
  Here are a few ideas to get you started
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Mushrooms, sausage  and ricotta</li>
